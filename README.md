# 2023 State Farm Coding Competition - Round 2

**Please be sure to read this entire document *PRIOR* to starting Round 2.**

## Change Log:

- November 12, 2023
    - 8:00am - Init and publish

## Getting Started

### Problem Statement

Round 1 was about reading JSON files, fetching and parsing through the mock disaster information, and passing unit tests. For Round 2, you'll be taking a more creative approach. We'd like to see you take your existing implementation and find ways to improve upon it.

These are some rough ideas to get the brain juices movin'. You do not necessarily have to follow these:

- Customer relationship management system with CRUD operations
- Taking our geographical information and creating a Geographic Information System (GIS)
- Expand the data schema by creating your own mock data and create relationships with the existing JSONs

### Rules

- Contestants cannot seek help from individual outside their team
- Contestants may use the Internet to do searches about code/framework functionality or install dependencies, but we **do not** want you to download existing applications and present them as your own. We want to see what type of features you can provide using your application alone.
- Contestants must use the data provided in their solution.
    - Contestants can make more records, add more columns, add additional new datasets, etc.

### When You Are Done

- Update the `FEEDBACK.md` and include the following information:
    - Team member name(s)
    - Team name (your decision)
    - Describe the features included to help the judges properly grade your submission, explain how to compile and run your submission, and document any bugs

### Presenting Your Submission

During your presentation you'll be asked to provide the following information:

- Your team name
- A short bio of each team member
    - School name
    - Graduation date
    - Degree path
- Any relevant personal links (LinkedIn, GitHub, portfolio site, etc.)
- Profile picture(s)
- Whatever other info you think is relevant
- A presentation on your solution
    - What problem(s) you're trying to solve
    - What is your solution
    - Demo / walkthrough features
    - Conclusion tieing back to problems solved, lessons learned, future goals

### How You Will Be Graded

The finals competition is broken up into three grading sections:

- Initial Online Competition -- 10 points
- Presentations -- 10 points
- Code Review -- 10 points
    - Features and enhancements
    - Creativity
    - Scalability and simplicity
    - Maintainability
    - Adherence to language-specific best practices such as styling, coding conventions, etc.

## Considerations

### Additional Ideas

Alongside the above rules and requirements, you can also consider the following ideas:

- Making something visual is strongly recommended
    - Will help for judging during your presentation
- For UIs
    - Material design
    - Responsive design
    - Accessibility
    - Animations
    - Your own branding
- For backend processes
    - Scalability and simplicity
    - Performance and optimizations
    - Uses of algorithms, data validation
    - Authentication and authorization

### Scope

You'll want to be realistic with your time. Some guidelines:

- Don't make everything as polished as possible, however, try to get the core concepts of your enhancements completed.
- Don't worry about unit tests. Delete them if they're a hinderance or enhance them if time allows.
- Application can run locally and doesn't need to be hosted.
- Try to limit bugs, however, we understand that with the limited timeframe, they will occur.
    - Be sure to document any known bugs in your `FEEDBACK.md`.

### Resuming from Your Round 1 Submission

Round 2 will be based off of your Round 1 submission. You'll want to make sure it still runs and that you update any dependencies as needed.

You can ignore passing unit tests. You can remove them if they hinder you.

## Questions?

E-mail [codingcompetition@statefarm.com](mailto:codingcompetition@statefarm.com), or to post a public question or report a problem, open an issue.

## Feedback

At the end of Round 2, we need you to fill out [FEEDBACK.md](./FEEDBACK.md). It includes a few questions such as team name, any notable characteristics, bugs, etc.
